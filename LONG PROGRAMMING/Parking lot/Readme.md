Parking Lot Management System Overview

This project is a Spring Boot–based backend application for managing a parking lot system. It provides RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations on vehicles and lays the groundwork for managing parking slots and lots.

The system follows a layered architecture with Controller, Service, Repository, and Entity components.

Returns a list of all vehicles Implemented in controller layer

Add Vehicle POST /api/update

Request Body:

{ "vehiclename": "Car", "ownername": "John" } Update Vehicle PUT /api/{id}

Updates vehicle details by ID

Delete Vehicle DELETE /api/{id}

Deletes vehicle by ID

Core Components Main Application

Entry point for the Spring Boot application

Controller Layer

Handles HTTP requests and routes them to the service layer

Service Layer

Contains business logic for vehicle operations such as save, update, delete

Repository Layer

Handles database operations using JPA

Entities Vehicle

Stores vehicle details such as name and owner

Slot

Represents parking slots and links to a vehicle

Lot

Represents parking lot metadata

How to Run Clone the repository git clone Navigate to project directory cd parking-lot Run the application mvn spring-boot:run Access API http://localhost:8080/api Improvements Needed Add validation for inputs Implement exception handling with proper HTTP responses Expand slot and lot management logic Add authentication and authorization Improve naming conventions (class names should follow Java standards: Controller, Service, Repository)
